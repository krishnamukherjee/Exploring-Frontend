          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</strong>, fondly known as the
            “Missile Man of India,” was one of the most respected scientists and
            statesmen the nation has ever produced. Born on 15 October 1931 in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he rose from humble beginnings to become the
            11th President of India. His life remains a powerful example of how
            dedication, integrity, and vision can transform both individuals and
            nations. Dr. Kalam played a pivotal role in India's space and
            defense programs. As a leading figure in the Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and later the Defence Research and Development
            Organisation (DRDO), he contributed significantly to the development
            of indigenous satellite launch vehicles and missile systems. His
            leadership in strategic programs strengthened India's self-reliance
            in critical technologies and enhanced national security.
          </p>
          <h3>The People's President</h3>
          <p>
            Serving as the President of India from 2002 to 2007, Dr. Kalam
            redefined the role with humility and accessibility. He was widely
            known as the “People's President” for his simple lifestyle, openness
            to dialogue, and special connection with students and young people.
            He believed that the youth were the driving force of national
            development and constantly encouraged them to dream big and work
            hard to realize their ambitions.
          </p>
          <h3>A Teacher and Mentor</h3>
          <p>
            Even after his presidency, Dr. Kalam devoted his life to teaching,
            lecturing, and interacting with students across the country. He
            emphasized values such as discipline, hard work, honesty, and
            perseverance. Through his books and speeches, he inspired millions
            to pursue excellence in science, technology, and social service
            while remaining grounded in ethical principles.
          </p>
          <h3>Enduring Legacy</h3>
          <p>
            Dr. Kalam passed away on 27 July 2015 while delivering a lecture,
            symbolically dedicating his last moments to education and the youth
            of the nation. His life and work continue to inspire generations to
            believe in the power of knowledge, innovation, and service to
            society. He remains a timeless role model for leadership rooted in
            humility and purpose.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam's journey from a small coastal town to the
            highest office in the country stands as a testament to the
            transformative power of education and determination. His vision for
            a developed, self-reliant, and ethical India continues to guide
            young minds. Paying tribute to him is not only a remembrance of a
            great leader but also a commitment to uphold the values he lived by
            and the dreams he shared with the nation.
